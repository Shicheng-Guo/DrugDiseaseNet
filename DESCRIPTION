Description: Generates a drug-disease network (DDN) composed of the genes that are most likely perturbed by a drug. By performing a system-level analysis on this network using disease gene expression signatures and drug-exposure gene expression signatures, the amount of perturbation caused by a drug on the genes can be estimated. This can help to identify the associations to a disease of interest.
